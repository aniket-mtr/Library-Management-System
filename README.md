The aim of this project is to maintain a database in a computerized format which can help in 
easy and efficient management of a library. Details about a lot of books, their authors and 
categories can be stored in the form of a database. This project has many features such as 
facility of user login and a facility of admin login. Through the facility of admin login, the admin 
can monitor the entire system. The facility of user login is created for students to issue books 
as they like from the library. It has a facility where a student after logging into their account 
can see list of books which can be issued, the list of books already issued, their issue date and 
return date. There is a facility of adding a new user or changing credentials of an existing user.
The admin can see the different users who have registered, total number of books available 
along with their information like category, author etc., the books that have been issued and 
also the books that have not been returned yet.</p>
